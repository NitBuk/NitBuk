# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm NitBuk

ðŸŽ¯ I'm a Computer Science student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, passionate about solving complex problems with programming.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in various programming languages and computer science concepts as part of my B.Sc. program.

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m open to collaborating on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a programmer. I particularly enjoy working on tasks that test my programming skills and knowledge.

ðŸš€ I believe in continuous learning and improvement, and I'm always up for engaging in meaningful conversations around technology and programming.

ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out to me by sending a message here on GitHub.
