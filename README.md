# 👋 Hello! I'm Nitzan

🎯 I'm a Computer Science student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Also, I'm passionate about solving complex problems with programming.

🌱 Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in various programming languages and computer science concepts.

💡 I’m open to collaborating on projects that challenge me and help me grow as a programmer. I particularly enjoy working on tasks that test my programming skills and knowledge.

🚀 I believe in continuous learning and improvement, and I'm always up for engaging in meaningful conversations around technology and programming.
